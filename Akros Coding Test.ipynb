    "Thankfully, we have a policy (assigned probability of choosing each action) fixed to choose the next action. Here comes Q function, also called state-action value function, that calculates how good it is for an agent to take actions in a state following policy specified. If we do weighted average of all possible q functions, we can find the value of possible next states, and if we discount it and add to the immediate reward, we can calculate V(s).\\\n",

As we do bunch of Bellman Expectation Equation, we will be able to find the policy that makes the maximum return. We call the policy we found \"optimal policy\" and the Bellman Equation that follows the optimal policy is called Bellman Optimality Equation.\\\n",
